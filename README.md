# Performing Convolution 1D, 2D, 3D, Noise addition and filtering

This python scrict demostrates 3 things:
1. Convolution 1D, 2D, 3D constructing by "hand" and not using some library for educational purposes. 
Padding **same** and **pad** are implemented.
2. Noise addition are implemented. Gaussian noise and salt&pepper noise. 
3. Image filtering using the above Conv2D, median and mean filtering are implemented

Images conteined show the results of the above actions.
